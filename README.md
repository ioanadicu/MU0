# MU0 Processor Project Overview 

This project focuses on the **design and hardware implementation of the MU0 processor**, a simple educational 16-bit CPU developed to teach core principles of computer architecture and embedded systems.

### MU0 Processor (Hardware Implementation)  
- Designed and simulated the MU0 processor in Verilog using a modular, top-down hardware description approach.  
- Built core components including the ALU, control unit, instruction decoder, register file, and datapath interconnects.  
- Developed testbenches in Tcl and verified timing and logic correctness using Mentor Graphics Questa Sim.  
- Gained hands-on experience with finite state machine (FSM) design, clocked sequential logic, and memory-mapped I/O at the register-transfer level (RTL).

## Project Tasks

- **Task 1:** Using the number pad for input on the development board.  
- **Task 2:** Creating a sensor semaphore to demonstrate hardware control.  
- **Task 3:** Designing and implementing the MU0 processor, the core focus of this project.  
- **Task 4:** Using the MU0 processor to control the board in a piano project: digits **1**, **2**, and **3** play preset songs, while other digits act as piano keys triggering buzzer sounds.

## Contents
